# Todo: Arithmetic Operators

# Todo:Arithmetic

# since % is reserved in Elixir, we use rem instead
IO.puts(rem(10, 4))
# Above code will return 2

# same for div
# Todo: DIV
# This function is used to get the quotient on division. -
# It helps you divide one number by another and gives you the whole number answer only
# â€” it removes the decimal (the point part).
# todo: div(10, 3)  # ðŸ‘‰ gives 3 | Because 10 Ã· 3 = 3.333...
# But div only gives you the 3 â€” it throws away the .333 part.
IO.puts(div(10, 3))
# Above code will return 2
